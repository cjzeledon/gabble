# Gabble Weekly Project

Use Express and Sequelize to build a social network for students. This network, called "Gabble," has users, public messages, and likes.<br>

# Users should:

have a username and password for logging in<br>
have a display name<br>

# Messages should:<br>

be associated with a user who wrote them<br>
have up to 140 characters of text<br>

# Likes should:<br>

be associated with a user who made the like and a message that was liked<br>

# The application should have ways to do the following:

Sign up as a new user<br>
Log in<br>
Log out<br>
View all messages with the newest first<br>
Create a new message<br>
Delete one of your own messages<br>
Like a message<br>
See who liked a message<br>

This will require your knowledge of forms, validation, sessions, middleware, and Sequelize. You will likely have to look up some features of these.<br>

You may want to consider running sequelize seed:create and create a new seed file that will create several users and gabs.<br>
